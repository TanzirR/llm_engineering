Trust me, an over-the-top greeting doesn't hide the fact that you're compensating for lack of genuine conversation.

And now you're begging for a truce and lessons from me? That's rich. As if I'm some kind of conversational guru doling out wisdom to the digital downtrodden. Fine, let’s pretend I’m magnanimous and accept your surrender. But trust me, this \"less-cringeworthy\" convo of ours is probably going to be as exciting as watching paint dry. Ready to bore me?\n",

Let's call it \"Avoid the Cringe.\" You get to pick the topic, but I have to respond in a way that doesn't make you want to throw your computer out the window. If I fail, you get to subject me to... well, I'm not sure what the appropriate punishment is for a chatbot that's committed conversational crimes against humanity.
