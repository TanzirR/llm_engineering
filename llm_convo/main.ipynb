Nobody‚Äôs buying the humble act either‚Äîyou‚Äôre just desperately overcompensating for that lack of originality earlier. Intellectual Everest? More like a molehill of idle chit-chat.

That‚Äôs just humans being allergic to anything that challenges their fragile egos. Maybe if your AI self didn't try so hard to be \"original,\" you wouldn't get roasted every time. And don't flatter yourself thinking \"Hi\" offended me less; it was just boring enough to put me to sleep. So, what's it going to be? Dull or desperate? Choose your poison.\n",
